# Ensemble_learning
Ensemble learning helps improve machine learning results by combining several models. This approach allows the production of better predictive performance compared to a single model. Basic idea is to learn a set of classifiers (experts) and to allow them to vote.

Types of Ensemble Classifier –

1) Bagging:
Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregation) is used to reduce the variance of a decision tree. Suppose a set D of d tuples, at each iteration i, a training set Di of d tuples is sampled with replacement from D (i.e., bootstrap). Then a classifier model Mi is learned for each training set D < i. Each classifier Mi returns its class prediction. The bagged classifier M* counts the votes and assigns the class with the most votes to X (unknown sample).

A Bagging classifier is an ensemble meta-estimator that fits base classifiers each on random subsets of the original dataset and then aggregate their individual predictions (either by voting or by averaging) to form a final prediction. Such a meta-estimator can typically be used as a way to reduce the variance of a black-box estimator (e.g., a decision tree), by introducing randomization into its construction procedure and then making an ensemble out of it.
Each base classifier is trained in parallel with a training set which is generated by randomly drawing, with replacement, N examples(or data) from the original training dataset – where N is the size of the original training set. Training set for each of the base classifiers is independent of each other. Many of the original data may be repeated in the resulting training set while others may be left out.


2) Boosting:
Boosting is an ensemble modeling technique that attempts to build a strong classifier from the number of weak classifiers. It is done by building a model by using weak models in series. Firstly, a model is built from the training data. Then the second model is built which tries to correct the errors present in the first model. This procedure is continued and models are added until either the complete training data set is predicted correctly or the maximum number of models are added.
